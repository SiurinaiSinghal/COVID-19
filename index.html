        <p>What's New in the Guidelines
            Last Updated: May 27, 2021
<br>
<br>
            The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treatment Guidelines is published in an electronic format that can
            be updated in step with the rapid pace and growing volume of information regarding the treatment of
            COVID-19.
<br>
<br>
            The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) is committed to updating this document to ensure that
            health care providers, patients, and policy experts have the most recent information regarding the optimal
            management of COVID-19 (see the Panel Roster for a list of Panel members).
<br>
<br>
            New Guidelines sections and recommendations and updates to existing Guidelines sections are developed by
            working groups of Panel members. All recommendations included in the Guidelines are endorsed by a majority
            of Panel members (see the Introduction for additional details on the Guidelines development process).
<br>
<br>
            Major revisions to the Guidelines within the last month are as follows:
<br>
<br>
            May 27, 2021
            The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel’s Statement on Baricitinib for the Treatment of Adults With COVID-19
            On December 14, 2020, the Panel released a statement regarding the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued
            by the Food and Drug Administration to make baricitinib available for certain patients with COVID-19. The
            Panel’s statement included recommendations based on the scientific evidence supporting the baricitinib EUA.
<br>
<br>
            Since the statement was released, the Panel has reviewed the preliminary results (not yet peer-reviewed)
            from COV-BARRIER, a trial of baricitinib in hospitalized adults. Based on this review, the Panel has updated
            its recommendations on the use of baricitinib for the treatment of adults with COVID-19, as outlined below.
<br>
<br>
            The Panel recommends using either baricitinib (BIIa) or tocilizumab (BIIa) (listed alphabetically) in
            combination with dexamethasone alone or dexamethasone plus remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in
            hospitalized patients on high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation who have evidence of clinical
            progression or increased markers of inflammation.
            Among hospitalized patients with hypoxemia who require supplemental oxygen therapy, there is insufficient
            evidence to identify which patients would benefit from the addition of baricitinib or tocilizumab to
            dexamethasone (with or without remdesivir). Some Panel members would add either baricitinib or tocilizumab
            to patients who are exhibiting signs of systemic inflammation and rapidly increasing oxygen needs while on
            dexamethasone, but who do not yet require high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation.
            In the rare circumstance when corticosteroids cannot be used, the Panel recommends using baricitinib in
            combination with remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized, nonintubated patients who require
            oxygen supplementation (BIIa).
            There is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of baricitinib in
            combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients who require invasive
            mechanical ventilation.
            The Panel recommends against the use of baricitinib in combination with tocilizumab for the treatment of
            COVID-19, except in a clinical trial (AIII). Because both baricitinib and tocilizumab are potent
            immunosuppressants, there is the potential for an additive risk of infection.
            There is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of baricitinib for
            the treatment of COVID-19 in children.</p>
